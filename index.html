  <h1>Firebird</h1>
  <p><b>TLDR:</b> Short-range, napalm/fire-outputing turret. Burning opponents continue to take damage even after the Firebird's attack stops. Can thaw frozen tanks.</p>
  <p>The Firebird is the key to urban warfare. It proved its effectiveness when Antaeus subdued the islands and metropolitan areas of the Pacific. This turret knows its stuff: set fire to your enemy's tank, and then move on. The burning napalm will devour enemy equipment without need for any outside support. Heavy tanks will have no chance. Does it seem like the weapon is taking too long to recharge? You can still shoot burning napalm at the enemy even from half-filled fuel tanks.</p>
</div>
<div class="desktop" id="two">
  <h1>Thunder</h1>
<p><b>TLDR:</b> Long-range turret.Shoots large pellets that damages enemies. Can also damage player if too close.</p>  <p>The Thunder turret was invented to eliminate the tank armies of the most modern Asian states, when Antaeus was ready to announce that it had completely taken over the world. "X" Tanks underwent a baptism of fire at a time when there were still far fewer of them than the previous generation of tanks. Under these conditions, the Thunder turret provided some assurance that the new tanks would be able to survive. The Thunder turret can be used to strike a group of enemies at once using explosive shells. The quick recharge rate ensures that you will achieve a quick and decisive victory.

  <h1>Vulcan</h1>
<p><b>TLDR:</b> Long-range, Machine gun turret. If fired too long, user begins losing health due to heat output of the turret.</p>  <p>The accurate and fast-firing Vulcan turret was Frontier's first line of defense during its first battles. Its stabilizers work perfectly when you are taking counter fire from the enemy. It is just the weapon for medium range fire when waging high-speed, Blitzkrieg warfare. It is imperative, however, to avoid overheating so that you do not damage your hull.</p>
</div>
<div class="desktop" id="four">
  <h1>Railgun</h1>
<p><b>TLDR:</b> Long-range, something-firing turret. Has infinite range, but slow reload.</p>  <p>A kinetic weapon and the "X" Tank are the ideal combination for waging battle in circumstances where any other weapon could fail. Huge open spaces proved to be excellent testing grounds for honing the performance properties of the Railgun. It is able to cut through several enemy tanks at once before they are even in range to offer counter fire.</p>
</div>
<div class="desktop" id="five">
  <h1>Freeze</h1>
<p><b>TLDR:</b> Short-range, turret that has ability to output "ice" that slows down opponents. Ice can be melted via firebird, or naturally aftr a long time.</p>  <p>High-speed "X" Tanks were used effectively during the first battles for Iran. Then the Freeze, a commanding weapon that was able to establish control on the battlefield, appeared. "Do not let the enemy move and escape from your range of fire" is the basic principle of this freon weapon, which is able to slow down and freeze your opponent's equipment.</p>
